h1. Aglet - a Twitter client with Shoes on

!>{border: 10px solid #fff}http://github.com/greatseth/aglet/tree/master%2Fwhale.png?raw=true!

Hallo. I was using Tweetr, one of many Twitter clients built on AIR. But it annoyed me. And I was curious about "Shoes":http://github.com/why/shoes. I like shoes. And Shoes is pretty good, too. Anyway, here is another Twitter client for your desk topping.

h2. Installation and Setup

You must have Shoes setup and run the app via Shoes. I am having errors with the packaged version of the app, at least on OS X. So, for now you need to clone a copy of the repo and run aglet.rb with the shoes command or Shoes.app.
  
  git clone git://github.com/greatseth/aglet.git
  cd aglet
  shoes aglet.rb

Due to suspicious hackery done to make the basic timline work, the periodic polling for new status updates also reloads the whole UI meaning that if you're entering your latest tweet for submission and the timer resets before you finish you will lose what you've typed. Shitty, yes. Sorry.

Oh, and growling support is quite primitive.

We're working on things, I swear! I intend to make this little toy much much cooler. Give me time!
