h1. Aglet - a Twitter client with Shoes on

!>{border: 10px solid #fff}http://github.com/greatseth/aglet/tree/master%2Fwhale.png?raw=true!

Hallo. I was using Tweetr, one of many Twitter clients built on AIR. But it annoyed me. And I was curious about "Shoes":http://github.com/why/shoes. I like shoes. And Shoes is pretty good, too. Anyway, here is another Twitter client for your desk topping.

h2. Installation and Setup

You must have Shoes setup and run the app via Shoes. Currently, I recommend running edge Shoes as that's what I do and I'm not well aware of the state of various releases. Visit "http://code.whytheluckystiff.net/shoes/wiki/BuildingShoes":http://code.whytheluckystiff.net/shoes/wiki/BuildingShoes for help installing on your platform.

Shoes has the ability to create packages you can just grab and run on various platforms, but I had trouble with that (on OS X, at least). I'll continue to work on this, so stay tuned!

h2. Known bugs of some significance

  * When submitting a new status update, you might not immediately see it appear
  in your timeline and the status input may not clear itself. Give it a minute.
  Often the status submitted fine.
  * Links for items near the end of the timeline might not have their active 
  hit area lined up correctly. This is a Shoes problem that at least affects
  OS X.
  
I of course intend to deal with these issues in time!
